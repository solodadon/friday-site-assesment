        <h2>His Background</h2>
        <p>NBA YoungBoy was born Kentrell DeSean Gaulden on October 20, 1999, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he was primarily raised by his grandmother, Alice Gaulden, who frequently appears in his lyrics. He wrote his first song in the fourth grade and pursued rapping at 14 on a microphone purchased at Wal-Mart. In 2015, he released his first mixtape, Life Before Fame.
 
            In 2016, at the age of 17, he was accused of jumping out of a car and opening fire on a group of people in Baton Rouge. Initially charged with attempted murder, he later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of aggravated assault and was sentenced to three years of probation. That year, he also released his 38 Baby project and signed with Atlantic Records in 2017.
             
            NBA YoungBoy’s upbringing was marked by violence and poverty. Following his grandmother’s passing, he found himself residing in a group home where he faced bullying and physical violence from his peers. Despite all of the trauma he experienced growing up, NBA YoungBoy has said that music always helped him to cope. During an interview with DJ Akademiks’ Off the Record podcast, he stated that it helps “calm” him and provides a place to say “what I need to say.”</p>
